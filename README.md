# Arena HumanSim

Modular, deterministic pedestrian simulator for the [Arena](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) framework. Simulates crowds of autonomous agents with realistic navigation, collision avoidance, social interactions, and behavior trees — all running as a ROS 2 node.

### Tick Loop

Each simulation step follows a fixed pipeline:

1. **Spawn / Despawn** — schedule new agents, remove completed ones
2. **Sense** — build neighbor graph (KDTree + FOV pruning → CSR sparse matrix)
3. **Decide** — tick behavior trees (every N ticks), emit high-level commands
4. **Global Plan** — A* pathfinding with LOS simplification and wall push-back
5. **Local Plan** — SFM / ORCA velocity computation (vectorized over pool)
6. **Interact** — update social interaction state machines
7. **Kinematics** — enforce acceleration, speed, and turning-radius limits
8. **Animate** — forward-integrate position and heading
9. **Collide** — resolve agent-wall overlaps
10. **Publish** - broadcast the flat `AgentFrame`, latched meta and gestures on change, and the `AgentViz` marker inputs

## Modules

All modules are swappable via a plugin registry.

| Layer | Options | Default |
|---|---|---|
| [Global Planner](arena_humansim/arena_humansim/global_planner/README.md) | `navmesh`, `astar`, `dijkstra` | `navmesh` |
| [Local Planner](arena_humansim/arena_humansim/local_planner/README.md) | `sfm`, `hsfm`, `orca`, `straight`, `socialgail` | `sfm` |
| [Perception](arena_humansim/arena_humansim/perception/README.md) | `default` | `default` |
| [Animation](arena_humansim/arena_humansim/animation/README.md) | `noop`, `kinematic` | `noop` |
| [Collision](arena_humansim/arena_humansim/collision/README.md) | `wall_projection`, `noop` | `wall_projection` |
| Occlusion | `bitmap`, `noop` | `bitmap` |

Each module is selectable as a ROS parameter and as a launch argument of the same name (e.g. `local_planner:=socialgail`). Scenario YAMLs do **not** carry a `modules:` block — module choice is a runtime decision, not a property of the scenario.

## Agent Types

Defined in YAML under [`config/agent_types/`](arena_humansim/config/agent_types/README.md). Each type specifies distributions over physical and behavioral parameters:

```yaml
name: adult
desired_velocity: { mean: 1.1, std: 0.12, clip_low: 0.5, clip_high: 1.5 }
agent_radius: { mean: 0.25, std: 0.02 }
perception:
  vision_range: { mean: 5.0, std: 0.5 }
  vision_fov: { mean: 180.0, std: 10.0 }
local_planner_params:
  relaxation_time: { mean: 0.5 }
  repulsion_strength: { mean: 2.1 }
needs:
  hunger: { initial: { mean: 100 }, decay_rate: { mean: 0.5 } }
```

Types support inheritance via `extends`. Parameters are sampled per-agent from their distributions, producing a heterogeneous crowd from a single type definition.

**Included types:** `adult`, `elder`

## Behavior Trees

Agents can operate in two movement modes:

- **Waypoint** — follow an explicit waypoint list (repeat / reverse / once / random)
- **Behavior Tree** — py_trees decision tree driven by needs, perceptions, and events

BTs are compiled from the agent type's `sequences`, `actions`, and `needs`. Needs decay over time and trigger actions when thresholds are crossed (e.g. hunger < 30 → eat).

**Authoring the YAML:** [`config/agent_types/README.md`](arena_humansim/config/agent_types/README.md#behavior-trees) documents `needs`, `actions`, `sequences`, `steps`, `transitions`, cancel steps, and autonomous steps with full field tables and examples.

**Internals / extending primitives:** [`core/behavior/README.md`](arena_humansim/arena_humansim/core/behavior/README.md) covers cross-node invariants (patience phases, seek/cancel semantics, compiler dispatch). [`core/behavior/nodes/README.md`](arena_humansim/arena_humansim/core/behavior/nodes/README.md) covers adding new `py_trees.Behaviour` primitives.

## Interactions

Matcher semantics (seek dispatch by handle kind, visibility gating, queueing, service binding) live in [`core/README.md`](arena_humansim/arena_humansim/core/README.md). Per-type defaults (handle kind, contract, formation, `allows_offer`, `interaction_radius`) are centralized in [`core/interaction_kinds.py`](arena_humansim/arena_humansim/core/interaction_kinds.py). The `interaction_radius` cascade and per-step field reference are documented in [`config/scenarios/README.md`](arena_humansim/config/scenarios/README.md).

| Type | Handle | Participants | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TALK_TO` | NONE | 2 | Face-to-face conversation |
| `GROUP_CONVERSATION` | NONE | 2+ | Multi-agent group talk |
| `WAVE_AT` | NONE | 2 | Symmetric greeting |
| `SIT_ON` / `LIE_ON` | OBJECT | 1 | Occupy furniture (FIFO queue) |
| `USE` | OBJECT | 1 | Use a world object (FIFO queue) |
| `QUEUE_USE` | OBJECT | 1+ | Queue for a shared resource |
| `BLOCK` | AGENT | 1-2 | Pursue and block a target agent |
| `SERVICE` | TAG | 1+ | Asymmetric provider/seeker pairing by tag (also subsumes escort/follow via `formation_spec: line, anchor_kind: provider`) |

Every interaction follows a single flow: a BT `SeekNode` emits a SEEK command, IM finds a matching open interaction and joins, or (if creation is allowed for this handle) creates one. Teardown is explicit — either a BT `CancelNode` (STOP with `reason=CANCELED`) or the contract's duration expiring (`COMPLETED`). Agents in active interactions defer despawn until the interaction ends.

## Spawning & Despawning

- **Sources** come in two types. `type: poisson` (default) emits at the `rate_profile` and loses arrivals over `max_concurrent`. `type: max` holds `max_concurrent` agents alive, refilling on despawn, and takes no `rate_profile`. Both respect `max_total`.
- **Sinks** absorb agents that reach them (within `absorption_radius`)
- Agents are routed from source to sink via weighted `sink_affinity`
- TTL-based removal as fallback

## Determinism & Replay

The simulator is fully deterministic given a seed. Seeded RNG substreams are maintained per agent and per component, and each substream's seed is derived by hashing `(seed, name)`, never by drawing from a parent stream, so a substream does not depend on which other substreams were requested before it. Sources sample each released agent (id, pose, speed and sink) from a `(seed, source, release index)` stream, so two runs with the same seed agree on every agent they both release. How many they release can differ for a `poisson` source under its cap, never for a `max` source.

`SimulationLogger` writes per-tick JSON snapshots. `ReplayManager` replays them tick-by-tick and validates state within floating-point tolerance (1e-12).

## Usage

### Launch

```bash
ros2 launch arena_humansim arena_humansim.launch.py \
  scenario:=queue \
  local_planner:=socialgail \
  markers:=2 \
  rviz:=true
```

Module-selection launch args (`perception`, `global_planner`, `local_planner`, `animation`, `collision`, `occlusion`) all default to the values in the parameters table below. Pass any of them on the command line to override. Any other launch arg is forwarded to the node as the param of the same name, e.g. `global_planner.resolution:=0.1` or `local_planner.relaxation_time:=0.7`, so the node's declarations stay the only list of params. The value is typed by YAML rules, so write a double with a decimal point. A name the node does not declare is ignored.

Scenarios (world objects, agents, flow, walls) are authored under [`config/scenarios/`](arena_humansim/config/scenarios/README.md).

### Run node directly

```bash
ros2 run arena_humansim arena_humansim_node \
  --ros-args -p mode:=master -p seed:=42 -p dt:=0.05
```

### Evaluation

`ros2 run arena_humansim evaluate <verb>` (or `python3 -m arena_humansim.utils.evaluation.cli <verb>`):

| Verb | What it does |
|---|---|
| `benchmark` | Parallel sweep over scenarios x drivers (x robot policies) x seeds, with an integrity gate per trial. |
| `analyze` | Pairwise trajectory Hausdorff, the class divergence ratio K with scenario-clustered CIs, kinematics, robot metrics, failure causes. |
| `partitions` | K per bucket under every driver-class partition (fine, binary, with and without `straight`). |
| `plots` | Regenerates the paper figures from the analysis CSVs. |
| `eth` | Speed, clearance and turn-rate distributions per driver against the ETH (EWAP) pedestrian dataset, and optionally one ATC day file, on a 0.4 s grid. |
| `correspond` | Released drivers against public references on held-out scenarios: `orca` vs Python-RVO2, `sfm` vs pysocialforce, `straight` vs closed form. |
| `verify` | Retroactive integrity check of a sweep dir. |

### Benchmark

```bash
ros2 run arena_humansim benchmark
```

Config format and stage semantics: [`config/benchmark/README.md`](arena_humansim/config/benchmark/README.md).

An integer set on a double param is widened, so `ros2 param set <node> global_planner.resolution 1` is accepted.

#### Runtime reconfiguration

A `set_parameters` call on a running node is validated and stored at once and takes effect at the next `reset` service call. `reset` with `soft: true` is the episode boundary. It keeps agents, world, clock, and RNG, applies the stored params, re-seats the agents, and prunes unused planners. A plain `reset` wipes the simulation first and then does the same. Every param outside the table is fixed at startup, and a set on it is rejected with `not reconfigurable at runtime`. A `set_parameters_atomically` batch is sorted by name. It may name a planner and that planner's `local_planner.<key>` params in any order, and it is rejected as a whole when one entry is invalid.

| Parameter | Effect at the reset |
|---|---|
| `global_planner.inflation_radius`, `global_planner.resolution`, `global_planner.comfort_radius` | The planner rebuilds its grid or mesh from the current walls and drops cached paths |
| `global_planner`, `local_planner` | The module is created on first use and gets the current walls and pool. An unknown module name is rejected at the set |
| `local_planner.<key>` | Mean of a local planner param (`relaxation_time`, `repulsion_strength`, ...). It replaces the mean of the agent type and keeps its spread. `0` leaves the agent type's own value. Declared for the keys of the startup planner and of every planner selected through `local_planner` |
| `waypoint_threshold`, `min_speed_for_heading`, `arrival_r_enter`, `arrival_r_exit`, `arrival_tau_brake`, `force_local_planner`, `profile_phases`, `profile_interval` | The node re-reads them. `arrival_r_enter` must stay below `arrival_r_exit` |
| `publish_markers` | The marker level changes. `0` deletes the published markers |
| `rtf` | Master mode only, retimes the tick timer |

Re-seating moves every live agent that follows the defaults onto the current local and global planner and shifts its planner params by the change of the mean, so it keeps its sampled offset. Three things stay fixed: an explicit `policy` of the spawn request, a planner named by the agent type, and a per-agent planner value. Pruning drops every local and global planner that no agent uses from the policy table, the wall and pool subscribers, and the module pool. The current defaults stay.

### ROS Interface

**Publishes:**
- `agent_states` (`AgentFrame`) - per-tick positions, velocities, radii, kinds, animation states and policy indices of the engine's own agents, one array per field
- `agent_meta` (`AgentMeta`, latched) - policy table plus name and handedness per agent, sent when it changes and at every reset, stamped like the frame of the same tick
- `agent_gestures` (`AgentGestures`, latched) - active gestures with their owner, sent when they change
- `viz_state` (`AgentViz`) - per-tick marker inputs while `publish_markers >= 1`, drawn into `viz` by `arena_humansim_viz_node` (started by the launch file, its `output_topic`, `offset_x` and `offset_y` parameters retarget and shift the markers at runtime). One message with `level: 0` clears the markers when the level drops to 0
- `viz`, `viz_static/<bucket>` (`MarkerArray`) - infrastructure and module markers drawn by the engine itself

**Subscribes:**
- `world_state` — external robot state updates
- `/clock` (subsystem mode) drives the tick: every message runs the ticks its sim time has covered since the epoch, so a held clock cannot starve the engine

**Services:**
- `spawn_agents`, `remove_agents` — direct agent control
- `add_source`, `remove_source`, `add_sink`, `remove_sink` — flow control
- `add_walls`, `remove_walls` — dynamic obstacles
- `set_flow` — bulk configure sources, sinks, walls
- `notify_stimulus` - drive a need on one agent (or `-1` for all) after its reaction time
- `reset` - clear all simulation state, or with `soft: true` keep it and only apply stored params, re-seat agents, and prune unused planners

## Development

Test layout (unit / contracts / integration / ros / perf / replay): [`arena_humansim/tests/README.md`](arena_humansim/tests/README.md).

### Linting

Linting is handled by [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), driven by [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). Config lives in `arena_humansim/pyproject.toml`; the hook pin is in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Auto-formatting is intentionally not enforced.

**One-time setup:**
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

**Everyday use:** hooks run automatically on `git commit` against staged files. To run manually:
```bash
pre-commit run            # staged files only
pre-commit run -a         # entire repo
ruff check arena_humansim # check without pre-commit
```

If the hook auto-fixes something, the commit is aborted and the fixes are left unstaged — `git add` and re-commit.

### CI

`.github/workflows/lint.yml` runs the same pre-commit hooks on every push to `master` and every pull request. The GH check uses the exact config and hook pins from `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, so local and CI never drift. Make the check required in branch protection to block merges on lint failures.

Bump the Ruff version with `pre-commit autoupdate`.
